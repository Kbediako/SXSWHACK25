# SOP: Rollback

1. Define clear rollback triggers in the PRD or mini-spec before release.
2. Maintain ready-to-run rollback scripts or builds and validate them in staging.
3. When triggered, freeze new changes, execute rollback steps, and notify stakeholders.
4. Capture logs, metrics, and operator notes for analysis.
5. Open or update `/tasks` entries to track remediation and verification work.
