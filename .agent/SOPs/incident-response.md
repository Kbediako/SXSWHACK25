# SOP: Incident Response

1. Declare the incident, assign roles, and open a shared timeline channel.
2. Stabilize the system first, prioritizing customer impact and safety.
3. Use spec-guard outputs, dashboards, and logs to triage; capture findings in `/tasks`.
4. Communicate status updates to stakeholders at agreed intervals.
5. Transition to recovery, hand off follow-up actions, and schedule postmortem work.
