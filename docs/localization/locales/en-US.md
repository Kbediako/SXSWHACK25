Last generated: 2025-10-17T05:02:44.741Z
## Cultural Insights

- Highlight inclusive, plain-language messaging that resonates with broad U.S. audiences and avoids idioms that may alienate international readers.
- Surface accessibility commitments early—Section 508 compliance and WCAG alignment remain expectations for enterprise buyers.
- Feature quantitative proof points and customer evidence; U.S. stakeholders rely heavily on metrics during evaluation.

## Linguistic Guidelines

- Prefer US spellings (e.g., “localization”, “organization”) and spell out measurements in imperial units with metric conversions where relevant.
- Adopt active voice with concise sentences (15–20 words) in alignment with Plain Language Guidelines.
- Capitalize product names (StitchFlow) consistently; avoid sentence case in CTA buttons.

## Regulatory & Compliance

- Clarify data residency and privacy posture with references to CCPA/CPRA where customer data processing is implied.
- Include an accessibility statement or link that references current WCAG conformance testing cadence.
- Document export controls or ITAR restrictions when marketing to U.S. federal or defense-aligned buyers.

## Tone & Voice

- Confident and consultative, balancing innovation language with pragmatic implementation support.
- Avoid jargon that presumes deep localization expertise; define specialist terms on first use.
