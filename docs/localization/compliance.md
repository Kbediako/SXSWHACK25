- Baseline Locale: en-US
- Reviewer of Record: Internal Localisation QA (rev-internal)

## Data Retention Policy

- Retain `.runs/0002/` artifacts locally for 90 days, mirroring them to `s3://localization-mvp-runs/` after day 30 for long-term storage.
- Keep stitched export bundles under `exports/localization-mvp/` for 30 days to support partner hand-off and QA.
- Redact reviewer PII from logs before public sharing; internal logs maintain reviewer IDs for auditability.

## Audit Trail Coverage

- `run.json` captures agent versions, prompts, and artifact paths for traceability.
- Change log manifests enumerate reviewer decisions with ISO timestamps.
- Guardrail logs (spec, lint, eval) are archived under `.runs/0002/<timestamp>/guardrails/`.
- Compliance check log (this run) records document generation and outstanding actions.
