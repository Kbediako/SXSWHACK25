# PRD â€” Derived Snapshot

> **Source of truth:** No canonical PRD yet in /tasks
> This file is a human-friendly mirror. When the PRD in `/tasks` changes, update this snapshot.

## How to Use
- Draft the canonical PRD under `/tasks` using `.agent/task/templates/prd-template.md` and guidance in `/.ai-dev-tasks/create-prd.md`.
- Once approved, mirror substantive updates here with a timestamped note.
- Keep this snapshot aligned with the canonical `/tasks` artifact before sharing broadly.
