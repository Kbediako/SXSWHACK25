# TODO: replace with upstream file

Follow this loop while implementing tasks derived from the PRD.
Work one subtask at a time, updating `/tasks/index.json` and the task file with progress notes.
Verify if a mini-spec is required or stale before touching code; request approval when needed.
Document outcomes and handoffs, then pause for review.
